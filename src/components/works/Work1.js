                        goers to see their favorite new movie releases.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducted interviews with possible users, and created empathy maps from the gathered responses to further understand users’ preferences and points for assistance.</li>
                        <li>The primary user group confirmed are adults who had struggles with booking tickets to watch movies, both physically and through online services. This confirmed the assumptions about moviegoers wanting to see movies in an earlier manner but was not able to do so at times due to several factors such as vicinity and availability.</li>
                        <li>Other factors learned includes the importance of information regarding theater offerings and seat variation and accessibility options.</li>

                    <p>Upon conducting ideation activities, including doing a competitive audit and storyboarding, paper wireframes were created to reflect both the necessary screens the user will be familiar to interact with and to also materialize features that will make the app effective in helping the user efficiently to the transaction.</p>
                </div>
                <div>

                    <p>Upon completing the necessary screens reflecting the overall flow of the application, a low-fidelity prototype was created, connecting the homepage to the suggestion, seat selection, payment confirmation, and ticket generation. The prototype was then shared with the participants of the conducted usability study through this link, to gain new insights.</p>

                    <p>Two rounds of usability studies were conducted, whereas insights from the first one were used to enhance the initially created wireframes toward their transition to mockups. Afterward, the insights from the second study aided in making the mockups more refined and polished.</p>
